							I am an experienced researcher with a diverse background in User Experience (UX) research, Cognitive Science and Computer Science. 
							
							During years of working as a sr design researcher, I've lead numerous generative/ evaluative research initiatives where creatively utilize/triangulate various methods (usability evaluation, field research, in depth interviews, diary studies, concept evaluation, and co-creation) throughout the e2e flow of the product life cycle, supporting design squads, product leads/owners, and business partners, in an agile environment.

							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My PhD in HCI involved the full process of designing, developing, and evaluation of a novel cognitive system for interactive virtual humans, to facilitate an enjoyable human-like interaction (two international projects <a href="http://movingstories.ca/about/">Moving Stories</a> & <a href="https://www.canarie.ca/software/platforms/movementmeaning/">Movement and Meaning</a>). 
							</br></br>
							&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My design research decisions are informed by 1) Vision formed by leading several studies to improve the experience of customers/ employees across personal, investing, insurance, and other banking platforms of Canada and U.S. 2) Deep understanding of human decision making process and perception developed by years of research on psychology and biology of human behavior and modeling emotion and personality. 3) Familiarity with people-centric thinking by supervising over 100 design projects, encouraging students to communicate their story/message through visual/web design elements. 4) Understanding the cycle of software/ app development process as a result of strong software engineering background.
