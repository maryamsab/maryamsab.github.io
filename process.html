				<h2>Educating teams on UXR Methods </h2> 
				<p class="just">
						I created a toolkit to educate the team on popular UX Research methods.
						</br> I provided context on what the methods are, when to use them, and when not to use them, and some best practices for each.
						</br> I shared the toolkit across teams to create alignment and awareness.
						</br></br>

				<h2>DIY guide for unmoderated usability </h2> 
				<p class="just">
						The only way to create a culture of curicity and research in the company is for everyone to get involved and actively be a part of research.
						</br>
						I utlized every opportunity to empower the team to support research.
						Specially I provided DIY templated to help the team independently plan, pilot, execute unmoderated usbaility evaluations (with the Usertesting.com). 
						</br>
						This guide is specially useful for new memebers of the team as they get onboarded and want to do their first unmoderated evaluation sessions.

				<h2>Collecting Questions and Scoping</h2>
					<p class="just">
						When allowed one of the best practices to collect research questions as a group and align on the priorities and existing knowledge is a practice called "Assumption Slam".
					</p>
					<img src="images/slam1.png" alt=" ">
					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
						During the activities all the stakeholders (designers, product owners, directors, etc) come with their assumptions about users.
						To tirgger critical thinking, I used practices such as 5W+H and questions like 'if you did not have resource for research what would be your biggest worry'. 
						We then as a group discuss 'how much risk there is if we do no research and the assumption turn out to be wrong.
						We also discuss as a group how much we know about each assumption.
					</p>

					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
					I then do a knowlege harvest on the resources available and specified by the team. 
					Next, I proposed the plan and methodology and share that with the team.
					</p>
				</br></br></br></br>
		
		
				<h2>Co-analysis</h2>
					<p class="just">
					One of the templates that encourages alignment and easier onboarding is the 'note taking template'. I encourage the team to use this template during the interview sessions and usablity evaluation.
					</p>
					<img src="images/coan0.png" alt="">
					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
					During the co-analysis workshop I bring the team together to share their learnings and participate in grouping the notes and affinity diagraming.
					</p>
					
				</br></br></br></br>
				
				
					<h2>Ideation</h2>
					<p class="just">
					I then move the extracted high level themes to the figma file. Then team will translate them to How Might We, vote on most impactful ones to ideate around. 
					
					</p>
					<img src="images/ideate0.png" alt="">
					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
						Activities like MoSCoW prioritization method can help the team set priorities. 
						Practices like crazy eight can encourage the team to ideate around the HMWs.
