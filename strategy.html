				<h2>Truth Repository</h2>
					<p class="just">
						During my time as a UX Researcher, I designed a repository for user & product facts aroud the banking app. The purpose of the truth repository  is to discovery and consolidate validated facts about the products as to maximize the lifecycle of research findings. 
						Each fact was a sticky note that was universal about the products and not dependent  on a project.
					</p>

					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
						Product designers, product owners, design directors, business and other stakeholders utilized  the repository to search for 'facts', where indicating their usage.
						While color coded facts were added by everyone, I held the responsibility of maintaining the repository, removing duplications, and clean up. 
						Facts were color coded and linked to the resources.
						Repository included context and instruction for easy use.

				<h2>Measurement Framework</h2>
					<p class="just">
					A measurement framework can provide a comprehensive picture of whether products are performing well. Although there are several measurement frameworks available (e.g., Google Heart Model), each company and industry has its specific needs and requirements. 
					</p>
					<img src="images/mf.png" alt="">
					</br></br>
					<p class="just">
						I created a framework that measured the success of product across interaction (what happened), perception (what uses thin & feel), client outcome (how client behavior change as a result), and business outcome (impact on business).
